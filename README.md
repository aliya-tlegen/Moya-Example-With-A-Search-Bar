# Moya-Example-With-A-Search-Bar

This small app consists of:
- UITableView 
- UISearchController

For practice purposes I used well-known JSONPlaceHolder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as an API 

and Moya Library (https://github.com/Moya/Moya) to work with networking requests: 
- .get, 
- .post, 
- .delete, 
- .put.
